#Advanced Keep Inventory
This plugin builds upon the already established /gamerule keepInventory command 
Meant as a way for users to pick and choose what items are kept or lost in a players inventory after they die.

#commands

/aki
  -toggle
    #toggles the command to be enabled/disabled.
  -include
    -[Material]
      #includes the material into a 
      list that DROPS after a player dies.
  -remove
    -[Material in list]
      #removes the material from the list
  -list
    #displays all items in the list
  -reset
    #removes all items from the list
    
There is no config file for this plugin (this will be different in future updates).
The plugin is autogenerated to be on and have nothing in it's drop list.
